### Notes
The biggest challange was trying to connecting the @IBOutlet collectionView.  When I tried connecting it the first time there was no option for an  @IBOutlet, instead it was some type Movie.  I double checked all of the storyboard identifiers and made sure they were correct only to come up short... so i ended up starting over from the superhero blank view controller point.
