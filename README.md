Flixter pulls the latest movies out in theaters and generates them as a list. Each item in the list has an image, title, and description. This app was the second assignment in Code Paths IOS bootcamp.

Additional features:

-[click on a movie item and it will segue into a different view controller]
-[you can go back to the original list by clicking the back button in the top left]
